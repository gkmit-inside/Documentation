# GKMIT INSIDE

## Project Overview

**GKMIT_INSIDE** is a specialized knowledge-sharing platform built exclusively for the GKMIT Organisation. It serves as an internal hub for long-form content, technical discussions, insights, and announcements.

## Vision

The platform aims to function as **"Twitter for GKMIT"** while focusing purely on structured knowledge rather than casual social interactions. Unlike generic social media platforms, GKMIT_INSIDE enforces a rigorous creation and review process to ensure content accuracy and value.

## Core Purpose

- **Knowledge Preservation**: Create an internal library of expertise and institutional knowledge
- **Structured Learning**: Facilitate continuous learning through organized, high-quality content
- **Community Collaboration**: Enable developers and admins to share insights and technical solutions
- **Quality Assurance**: Maintain content standards through a structured review process

## Platform Philosophy

GKMIT_INSIDE is designed around three core principles:

1. **Structured Content Creation**: Every post follows a defined format with proper categorization
2. **Quality Over Quantity**: Admin approval ensures only valuable content reaches the community
3. **Role-Based Collaboration**: Different user roles enable controlled contribution and growth

## Target Audience

The platform is built for three distinct user groups within the GKMIT community:

- **Newcomers**: New members who need read-only access to learn from existing knowledge
- **Developers**: Contributors who create and share technical content
- **Administrators**: Moderators who ensure content quality and manage platform operations
