## Project Overview

**GKMIT INSIDE** is a specialized knowledge-sharing platform built exclusively for the GKMIT Organisation. It serves as an internal hub for short-form content, technical discussions, insights, and announcements.

- **Structured Learning**: Facilitate continuous learning through organized, high-quality content
- **Community Collaboration**: Enable employees to share insights and technical solutions
- **Quality Assurance**: Maintain content standards through review process

## Target Audience

The platform is built for two distinct user groups within the GKMIT community:
